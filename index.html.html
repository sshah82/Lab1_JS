        <h2>Forecasting Natural disaster</h2>
        <p>According to Our World in Data, each year natural disasters kill an average of 45 000 people worldwide. They impact the quality of life of many more people, and cost billions in economic damage. And worryingly, the impacts of disasters may become worse due to growing urbanisation and increasing numbers of extreme weather events. Timely forecasting of natural disasters could help save lives and reduce the impact on the economy. In the past, it has been difficult to predict such disasters, but satellites are able to provide new information to make it much easier to act in a quick and coordinated manner. One of the first studies ran under a working group consisting of representatives of space agencies around the world, set up by ESA to research global disaster hotspots. The long-term vision of this group is for space agencies to coordinate their resources so that Earth observation data can be used to forecast all types of natural disasters. The study investigated which space technologies should be developed to achieve this.</p> 
        <h2>Monitoring Marine Litter</h2>
        <p>Approximately 13 million tonnes of plastic finds its way into the ocean every single year. Most of this sinks to the sea floor, but some remains floating on the surface. From there, it can wash up on coastlines, affecting not just wildlife but also coastal communities, tourism and the food chain. Monitoring this plastic can be very difficult from Earthâ€™s surface, as it is impossible to see much of the surface at once. But remote sensing, including satellite remote sensing, could change our ability to monitor plastic waste, and Discovery & Preparation is supporting studies that investigate the best way of doing so. Measurements from space are already used indirectly to get to grips with the problem of marine litter, for example maps of ocean currents can inform us where plastic is likely to move to, so we can work out approximate large-scale plastic concentrations around the world, such as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.</p>
